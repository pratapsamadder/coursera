				<h3>Python</h3>
				<p>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for
				general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first 
				released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy
				which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit
				code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers 
				to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
				The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.

				implementation is now produced by The PHP Development Team.[5] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[4]
				but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
